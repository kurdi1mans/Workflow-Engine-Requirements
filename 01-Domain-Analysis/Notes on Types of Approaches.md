- There are three parts here
	- The Workflow part
		- Steps
		- assignments
		- actions
		- activities
		- retries
		- error handling
		- Automation
		- Scalability
		- locking
		- lock-timeout
		- escalations
		- reminders
		- dynamic assignees
		- notifications
		- auto-spawning
	- The Forms and Display part
		- Display
		- Formatting
		- Field Types
		- Field Constrains (ViewOnly, Editable, Editable-Required)
		- Formulas
		- References (live, DOA, DOC)
		- Dynamism
	- Access Control Part
		-  Roles, Variants, Visibility, Required Fields, Hiding and Showing Fields

- There are multiple approaches to handle business data
	- Master-Only approach
		- With Audit Logs
		- With Locking mechanism (different levels of locking granularity)
	- Master-Revision approach
		- Different ways to implement this
			- Revision is created separately
			- Revision is initiated from un-committed changes on the primary
		- Requires proper conflict resolution mechanism (think Gitlab merge requests)
			- What if a revision is initiated and an older revision is still pending approval?
			- What if revisions are not technically in-conflict but they are logically in conflict?
				- Example: Two developers created two installation scripts in parallel. One called his script install.js. The other called his script setup.js. These two new files will not cause a merge conflict as they are newly added. However, logically, they are in-conflict.
	- Workflow approach
	- Transaction approach
	- Request-based approach
		- No master records
		- Latest and greatest state is generated by reporting logic
	- Synchronous Transaction
	- Asynchronous Job (Saga / Long-running Job)
	- Document (or Content) Management Software
		- EDMS
	- Event-Driven Systems
	- Space-Based Architecture (SBA)
	- Digital Integration Hub Architecture (DIH)
