- Pure Functions
	- **Pure Functions**:
	    - Always produce the same output for the same input.    
	    - Do not have side effects (e.g., modifying a global variable or I/O).
	- **Immutability**:
	    - Data is never modified. Instead, new data structures are created when changes are needed.
	- **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**:
	    - Functions are treated as values: they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
	- **Function Composition**:
	    - Small functions are combined to build more complex operations.
	- **Recursion**:
	    - Used instead of loops for iteration.
	- **Referential Transparency**:
	    - Expressions can be replaced with their values without changing the programâ€™s behavior.
- Our Standard for functions
	- All inputs must be passed in parameters
		- Allows for better testing
		- Database reads?
	- No input shall be mutated
		- No side effects
	- The State inside the function must never be accessible from outside the function and must never be shared across the runs of the same function
		- The state of the function is born with the run of the function and dies with it.
		- The state of the function is never shared with anything (including another run of the same function that is taking place in parallel or in the future).
		- Functions must be stateless to the outside world.
	- Database read/write operations are allowed
	- Recursion must be avoided as much as possible due to the fact that it can cause stack overflow errors
