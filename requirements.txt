- The workflow engine must be built as a javascript library.
- From here on, the library will be referred to as the system.

- The library must provide functions to create its own datamodel inside a database as per the developers choosing
	- The developer might choose a separate database for the datamodel of the library
	- The developer might choose a separate schema for the datamodel of the library

- The library must provide functions to create/modify/delete Forms
	- Forms must contain blocks
	- Blocks contain fields
	- What fields will be read-only, editable, or required is not the concern of the forms functions
	- fields
		- field can auto-populate from other records
			- there has to be an option for specify if the auto-population is live, dead-on-arrival, or dead-on-condition
	- views

- The system must allow for merging records
- The system must allow for cloning records
- The system must provide drag-fill functionality for cells

- Fields Definition
	- Field Names can be changed
		- How will dataviews deal with name changes?
	- The system must allow for fields to have formula
		- The system must allow for bi-directional formulas
			- 3 fields (or more) all have formula
			- input values in first n fields, the last will be calculated by the formula
			- the oldest updated field will be set to formula if a new field is updated manually
		- Formulas can have any of the following logic
			- Arithmetics: +,-,*,/,^,log ... etc
			- logical operators such as: and, or, not, xor, xnor ... etc
			- if conditions such as: if, else if, else
			- conditionals such as >,<,>=,<=,=,!= ... etc
			- Date arithmatics and conditionals
			- String operations: substring, concatenate, split ... etc
			- Lookup functions??
			- Rollup fields (for lineitems/sub-records)

- Transactional Processing
	- The system must allow for transactional processing
	- The system must allow for a balance sheet like functionality
		- Similar to SOV in Unifier
		- Similar to a booking calendar
		- Similar to seat availablity on air-planes
		- This requires transactional processing

- File Management
	- The system must provide the capability to upload files
		- The system must provide the capability to resume upload/download
	- The system must provide OCR capability to generate searchable content for files
	- The system must provide the capability to store files in a tag-based file system
		- This will allow better classification and better accessability of files

- The system must provide functionality to provide digitally signed documents
	- This functionality must also allow integration with 3rd party service providers


- Workflow Steps
	- Steps and Actions
		- definition of steps and actions
	- Validations
		- definition of validations per action
		- validations must be action specific. For example, if the selected action is to reject the record, there is no need to verify anything.
	- The workflow must provide steps for automated actions
		- send emails
		- run integrations
		- Exponential Back-Off
		- Rate Limiting
		- ... etc


- Types of Data and Data Structures
	- The system must allow for creation of tables/lineitems in a form.
	- Lineitems can be viewed in the record as tables or as tab that shows them as records on their own.
	- The system must allow for multi-leveled record creation in the form of parent-child relationship.
		- This allows establishing trees.
		- The system must also allow visualizaing this type of records as trees
	- The system must provide alternate views for the register/sheet
		- For example, if I want to view the record like a ticketing system (say Zoho Desk), the fields of the record should be shown on the side.
	- The system must provide multiple options for view of the log of the register/sheet
		- example Zoho Desk
			- View can be set to show the record field on the side
			- The main body of the record shows email threads
	- The system must allow for linking the records with email threads

- Access Control
	- Workflow steps can have assigned groups
		- Records can be sent to a step even if the assigned group has no members
		- At any point of time, if a user is added to a group, the
	- The system must provide the capability to control access as per the principals of Variant-Based Access Control
	- Access control is also to be defined at field-level
	- The system must allow the user to create his own sheets

- Custom Prints
	- The system must provide the capability to create custom prints
	- Custom prints must be built with blocks
	- Design of blocks must be generic and resuable
	- Blocks must be dynamic as per the data it receives
	- Custom prints must allow exporting to Excel, Word, PDF ... etc.

- Versions and Drafts
	- The system must provide versioning for records
