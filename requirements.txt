- The workflow engine must be built as a javascript library
- The library must provide functions to create its own datamodel inside a database as per the developers choosing
	- The developer might choose a separate database for the datamodel of the library
	- The developer might choose a separate schema for the datamodel of the library

- The library must provide functions to create/modify/delete Forms
	- Forms must contain blocks
	- Blocks contain fields
	- What fields will be read-only, editable, or required is not the concern of the forms functions
	- fields
		- field can auto-populate from other records
			- there has to be an option for specify if the auto-population is live, dead-on-arrival, or dead-on-condition
	- view
- workflow engine
	- definition of steps and actions
	- definition of validations per action
		- validations must be action specific. For example, if the selected action is to reject the record, there is no need to verify anything.

- The system must allow for fields to have formula
- The system must allow for bi-directional formulas
	- 3 fields (or more) all have formula
	- input values in first n fields, the last will be calculated by the formula
	- the oldest updated field will be set to formula if a new field is updated manually
- Formulas can have any of the following logic
	- Arithmetics: +,-,*,/,^,log ... etc
	- logical operators such as: and, or, not, xor, xnor ... etc
	- if conditions such as: if, else if, else
	- conditionals such as >,<,>=,<=,=,!= ... etc
	- Date arithmatics and conditionals
	- String operations: substring, concatenate, split ... etc
	- Lookup functions??
	- Rollup fields (for lineitems/sub-records)
- The system must allow for merging records
- The system must provide drag-fill functionality for cells
- The system must allow for linking the records with email threads
- The system must provide alternate views for the register/sheet
	- For example, if I want to view the record like a ticketing system (say Zoho Desk), the fields of the record should be shown on the side.
- The system must provide multiple options for view of the log of the register/sheet
- The system must allow for transactional processing
- The system must provide the capability to control access as per the principals of Variant-Based Access Control
- The system must allow the user to create his own sheets
- The system must provide OCR capability to generate searchable content for files
- The system must provide the capability to store files in a tag-based file system
	- This will allow better classification and better accessability of files


- Field Names can be changed
- How will dataviews deal with name changes?
- The system must allow for a balance sheet like functionality
	- Similar to SOV in Unifier
	- Similar to a booking calendar
	- This requires transactional processing
- The system must provide the capability to upload files
	- The system must provide the capability to resume upload/download
- The system must provide functionality to provide digitally signed documents
	- This functionality must also allow integration with 3rd party service providers
- The workflow must provide steps for automated actions
	- send emails
	- run integrations
