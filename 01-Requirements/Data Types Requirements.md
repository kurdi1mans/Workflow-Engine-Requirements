- Some data types are just specific form of other data types.
+ For Example, phone number (+966-5-12345678) is a restricted type of String. The same applies to emails.

- What other data types?
+ Video

- I should not worry about the datatypes in the database as they are very limited
- What I should worry about is the different types of fields as per the way they are visualized on the front-end and their behavior.
	- Then, the secondary concern is how they are similar to each other.
